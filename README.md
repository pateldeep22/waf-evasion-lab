# WAF Rule Development and Evasion Testing Lab

This project provides a complete lab environment for developing, testing, and hardening Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules using ModSecurity. The primary goal is to defend a vulnerable web application (DVWA) against common attacks like SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and then to simulate advanced evasion techniques to improve the resilience of the custom rules.

This repository contains all configuration files, custom rules, attack payloads, and detailed reports generated throughout the project.
